## Synopsis
AHP allow the analytic hierarchy process by a python script.


## Code Example
A mathematical, and coherent, translation of human choices is provided.

## Motivation


## Installation
The script only needs Python 2 installed.
Then, only execute the ahp.py file in the same directory you download the main file:
	python ahp.py
        The folders called choices_all and choices should stay in the same directory too. 

## API Reference


## Tests
The script is provided with a test file (called “ahp_test.py”) for testing. 

## Contributors
Permit the storage in a separate file of the choices.
Let's write the choices file in a xml style
(not a different way parsed style).
